    <h1>Link 4 Instructions</h1>
    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Link 4 is a two-player game played on a grid of six rows and seven
      columns.  The goal of the game is to get four of your pieces in a row,
      either horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.
    </p>
    <p>
      Play alternates between the two players.  On your turn you may play a
      piece in one of the seven columnns on the board.  Pieces
      &ldquo;fall&rdquo; to the lowest available position in that column.  As
      soon as either player manages to get four pieces in a row, the game is
      over and that player wins.
    </p>
    <h2>Player Types</h2>
    <h3>Human Players</h3>
    <p>
      Human players are controlled by the mouse.  When it is your turn, click
      on one of the seven columns to play your piece.  You may click anywhere
      in the column.
    </p>
    <h3>Computer Players</h3>
    <p>
      Computer players play automatically by examining every possible move for
      a certain number of turns.  The number of turns the computer looks ahead
      is controlled by the <dfn>depth</dfn> setting when setting up the game.
      Computer players will play their piece automatically.  Note that setting
      the depth to a large number may result in the computer taking a long
      time to select a move.
    </p>
    <h3>Rule-Based Players</h3>
    <p>
      Rule-based players play automatically by following rules contained in a
      file.  The rule file should be selected when setting up the game.  The
      format of a rule file is described below.  Rule-based players will play
      their piece automatically.
    </p>
    <h2>The Turn Browser</h2>
    <p>
      As the game progresses, each turn is recorded in a list to the right of
      the board.  At any point in the game the player may scroll through the
      list and click on different turns.  Clicking on a turn will reset the
      board to what it looked like at that turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is possible to start playing a game from one of these previous
      turns.  Note, however, that making a move will throw out all turns
      following the selected turn, resulting in a different game.
    </p>
    <h2>Rule Files</h2>
    <p>
      rule files are plain-text files, also known as &ldquo;Text
      Documents&rdquo;.  You should create these files using a text editor
      such as Notepad for Windows or TextEdit for Mac.  (When using TextEdit,
      you must look in the <code>Format</code> menu and
      select the option
      labeled <code>Make</code> <code>Plain</code> <code>Text</code>.)  Beware
      that many word processors such as Microsoft Office will not save files
      as plain-text files without coersion.
    </p>
    <p>
      In general, the program will try to understand all text inside a rule
      file; therefore all the text in a rule file should follow the syntax
      defined below.  There is one exception: any text following a pound sign
      (<code>#</code>) is ignored.  Such text is considered
      a <dfn>comment</dfn> and may be used to add notes to the file without
      violating the syntax defined below.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that rule files are <em>case sensitive</em>.  That is, the program
      distinguishes between uppercase letters and lowercase letters, and will
      reject a rule file if it uses the wrong case.  Thus, in the following
      description you should pay attention to whether uppercase or lowercase
      letters are used.
    </p>
    <p>
      A rule file consists of one or more <dfn>rule sets</dfn>.  Each rule
      set contains two sections:  a <dfn>patterns</dfn> section and
      a <dfn>rules</dfn> section.
    </p>
    <h3>Patterns</h3>
    <p>
      A pattern is simply a representation of a game board using different
      characters to represent different possible values for each tile on the
      board.  The characters you may use in a pattern are:
    </p>
    <table class="patterns">
      <tr>
        <td>X</td>
        <td>One of your pieces</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>O</td>
        <td>One of your opponent's pieces</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>+</td>
        <td>Any piece (yours or your opponent's)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>-</td>
        <td>No piece (tile is empty)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>*</td>
        <td>
          A playable tile (empty, and either on the bottom or the tile below
          is non-empty)
        </td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>?</td>
        <td>Anything</td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>
      Spaces in a pattern are ignored; i.e., they match anything just as a
      question mark.
    </p>
    <p>
      Patterns should form a grid where lines are rows and individual
      characters are columns.  However, a pattern does not need to be as big
      as the entire board; it can be smaller, allowing it to be matched in
      multiple positions of the board.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, consider the following pattern:
    </p>
    <pre class="bq">
??--
OOX-
++X*
</pre>
    <p>
      This pattern describes a section of the board consisting of three rows
      and four columns.  The bottom row has any two pieces, a player's piece,
      and a playable tile.  The second row has two opponent's piece, a
      player's piece, and an empty tile.  The third row can have anything in
      the first two tiles but the last two tiles must be empty.  This pattern
      could match any section of the board as long as each piece in that
      section matches the corresponding character of the pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to the above characters, you may also use lowercase letters
      as variables.  Each variable may occur only once in a pattern, but
      multiple patterns can use the same variable.  Variables are assigned a
      pattern character by a rule and must match the pattern assigned to it.
      Rules which share a pattern may each assign different pattern characters
      to each variable.
    </p>
    <p>
      Unless a pattern is a palindrome (i.e., identical when read in reverse)
      the reverse pattern will automatically be added to a ruleset as well.
      For example, consider the following pattern.
    </p>
    <pre class="bq">
aXXX
</pre>
    <p>
      This will result in the following pattern also being added to the rule set.
    </p>
    <pre class="bq">
XXXa
</pre>
    <p>
      Now consider the following pattern.
    </p>
    <pre class="bq">
a
X
X
X
</pre>
    <p>
      This pattern is the same read left-to-right and right-to-left.
      Therefore no other patterns will be added to the rule set.
    </p>
    <h3>Rules</h3>
    <p>
      A rule is written on one line.  It consists of two
      parts: <dfn>definitions</dfn> and <dfn>actions</dfn>.  The definitions
      are written first, followed by a colon, followed by the actions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Definitions simply assign a pattern character to each variable.  This is
      written as a variable name, followed by an equal sign, followed by a
      pattern character.  If there are multiple definitions they must be
      separated by commas.
    </p>
    <p>
      Actions assign a score to a column based on a variable.  Scores given by
      each rule will be added up, and the column with the highest score will
      be selected as the best move.  An action is written as a variable name,
      followed by either a plus or minus sign, followed by a number.  The
      number will either be added (for plus) or subtracted (for minus) to the
      column which contains the specified variable.  If there are multiple
      actions they must be separated by commas.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, consider the following rule.
    </p>
    <pre class="bq">a=X, b=O : a+5, b-2</pre>
    <p>
      This rule specifies that the variable <code>a</code> must match a player
      piece and the variable <code>b</code> must match an opponent piece.  The
      action adds five to the score of the column that
      contained <code>a</code>, and subtracts two from the score of the column
      that contained <code>b</code>.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is one special score that may be given, indicated by an
      exclamation mark.  A score of <code>+!</code> means the column should
      immediately be selected and no further scoring should be attempted.  A
      score of <code>-!</code> means the column should be immediately rejected
      and not considered any further.
    </p>
    <h3>Rule Sets</h3>
    <p>
      A rule set always begins with a line consisting solely of the word
      &ldquo;PATTERNS&rdquo;.  After that should come one or more patterns.  A
      blank line is used to indicate the end of a pattern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next should be a line consisting solely of the word
      &ldquo;RULES&rdquo;.  After that should come one or more rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is no special marker for the end of a rule set.  It ends either
      when the file ends, or when the word &ldquo;PATTERNS&rdquo; is found,
      indicating the beginning of the next rule set.
    </p>
    <p>
      When applying a rule set in order to select a move, rules are applied in
      the order in which they appear in the file.  When applying a rule, each
      pattern in the rule set is matched against the board using the variable
      definitions given in the rule.  Every time a match is found, the actions
      of the rule are performed, modifying the scores as specified.
    </p>
    <h3>Examples</h3>
    <p>
      As an example, consider the following rule set.
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
PATTERNS

ab

a
b

RULES

a=*, b=X : a+1
a=*, b=O : b-1

</pre>
    <p>
      This rule set specifies two patterns and two rules.  However, note that
      the first pattern is not a palindrome; therefore the
      pattern <code>ba</code> is also added to the rule set.  The second rule
      is a palindrome, so no further patterns are added.  Thus this rule set
      actually has three patterns and two rules.
    </p>
    <p>
      To apply this rule set we begin with the first rule.  Thus, all three
      patterns will be matched using the definitions of the first rule.  The
      first pattern, <code>ab</code>, will match playable tiles to the left of
      a player's piece.  The second pattern, <code>ba</code>, will match
      playable tiles to the right of a player's piece.  The third pattern will
      match playable tiles on top of a player's piece.  In each case, one
      point will be added to the column with the playable piece.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next we use the second rule.  Again, all three patterns will be matched
      using the definitions of the second rule.  This time the patterns will
      match playable tiles next to the opponent's piece and subtract one from
      their scores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that our rule set does <em>not</em> contain a rule that tests
      for <code>b</code> as a playable piece, such as the following rule.
    </p>
    <pre class="bq">
a=X, b=* : b+1
</pre>
    <p>
      Because our rule set contained both the patterns <code>ab</code>
      and <code>ba</code>, such a rule would effectively be a duplicate of the
      first rule in our rule set.  If both rules were in our rule set, pieces
      to the left or right of a player's piece would have <em>two</em> added
      to their score instead of just one.
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 3em">
      As another example, consider the following rule set.
    </p>
    <pre class="example">
PATTERNS

abcd

a
b
c
d

a
+b
++c
+++d

RULES

a=*, b=X, c=X, d=X : a+!
a=X, b=*, c=X, d=X : b+!
a=X, b=X, c=*, d=X : c+!
a=X, b=X, c=X, d=* : d+!

a=*, b=O, c=O, d=O : a+!
a=O, b=*, c=O, d=O : b+!
a=O, b=O, c=*, d=O : c+!
a=O, b=O, c=O, d=* : d+!
</pre>
    <p>
      To apply this rule set we begin by matching all patterns using the
      definitions of the first rule.  Next, we match all patterns using the
      definitions of the second rule.  In this way, we continue until all
      rules have been applied.
    </p>
    <p>
      Notice that the first four rules all describe scenarios in which the
      player can win in a single move.  The second four rules all describe
      scenarios in which the opponent can win in a single move.  (The blank
      line in between is not significant; it is only there to make it easier
      to read the rules.)  The actions all result in the playable column being
      selected immediately.  Because rules will be applied in order, this rule
      set will <em>first</em> try to select a winning move.  If no winning
      move can be found, it will try to block the opponent from winning.
    </p>
    <p>
      As with the previous example, we should remember that reverse patterns
      are added to the rule set.  Pattern 2 is a palindrome, and therefore its
      reverse is not added.  The reverse of pattern 3 is helpful because it
      checks for diagonals going in the reverse direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      The reverse of pattern 1 will result in duplicates.  For example, rule 1
      with pattern1 is the same as rule 4 with the reverse of pattern 1.
      However, as these rules immediately select a column for play, the
      duplication is harmless.  If the first rule matches, the column will be
      immediately selected and the duplicate ignored.  If the first rule does
      not match, the duplicate will not match either.
